<h1>Glitch Art</h1> <br>
<p>These pieces are about how we perceive what beauty is. Today we have so many filters and programs that manipulate images that tell us what is beautiful. The result of that is that the notion of beauty gets distorted. So my attempt was to glitch these images of models to show a literal sense of distorted beauty because, in today's society, that's what is given to us.</p> <br> <br>
